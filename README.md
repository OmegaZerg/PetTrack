# PetTrack
App to help track and manage pets! An overview of features are listed below.

## Instructions to run
- There are no dependancies other than python at this time (as of current version 0.2.0 - 8/4/2025)
1. Clone the Repo
2. Remove the data directory (or don't...im not your supervisor or anything)
3. Run main.py
4. Use the app
5. Report bugs/issues (if you must) -- Seriously do though and ill get 'em taken care of.

## Pet Specific Reminders
- Cats: reminder for when litter needs to be changed
- Birds: reminder for when newspaper/woodchips need to be changed

1. Practice Python by making a usefull CLI application
2. Have fun (is that allowed?)

## Future Plans
1. Refactor into a project that utilizes a full UI.
2. Possibly re-implement in a different language.
3. Refactor the overall project structure. Having a full UI will help tremendously with this.
